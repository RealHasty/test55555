        <h1>Favorite culture that I'm not native to</h1>
            <p>Japan would be my favorite culture that I am not native to. I say this because I am a big fan of the cherry blossim trees
                 and the nice clean city atmosphere they have there. Plus the sushi they have is a really good price as well as 
                tasting of high quality.</p>

        <h1>Two historical figures that I aspire to be like</h1>
        <p>Linus Torvalds or Steve Jobs,
            being like Linus Torvalds shows the value of innovation and collaboration in 
            tech and Steve Jobs highlights the importance of creativity and persistence in 
            achieving success. Both demonstrate how passion and hard work can lead to big changes and inspire others.

        <h1>A meal that represent me</h1>
        <p>Milanesa, I choose this dish because it is something that holds
            sentimental value to me more than just how it tastes.

            <h1>When I feel the most creative</h1>
        <p>I feel the most creative when I am in a more stressful time crunched situation that requires me to give my full attention to the task at hand.</p>

            <h1>One topic I can talk about for the rest of my life</h1>
            <p>I could talk about indivdual perspective, I am really fascinated about how everyone has a
                different perspective on life even when they can have the same enviorment growing up. </p>
